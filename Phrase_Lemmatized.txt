let down 
what be the matter 
of good humor 
have a good time
have fun
piss off 
tell the truth 
would rather not 
pick on 
play around with 
make a fool 
talk bad about 
talk trash about 
play a joke on 
play a trick on 
pull a prank on 
take advantage of 
mess with 
call someone out 
ache for 
creeped out 
keep as an inside voice 
keep thought to yourself 
go against 
go along with 
get him go 
have a ball 
have a crush 
heart melt 
say nice thing 
have a good time 
have tension with 
have an opinion 
be influence by 
seem cool 
play it off cool 
could have swear 
be against someone 
make look bad 
be sure 
be on edge 
read someone’s mind 
heck of a time 
wind up 
what be wrong 
break her heart 
put her down 
jump to conclusion 
freak out 
pay mind 
right state of mind 
hide the truth
make a mistake
make fun of
